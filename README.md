A quick 2d ocean simulation using Pico-8. Utilizing the sum of sines to produce a psuedo-random wave on each run.
Currently, the position each pixel is being calculated in the draw loop so it lacks efficiency at a wave number higher than 25.

In order to run this file, you will need to have pico-8 until I use a tool to export it to a standalone file.
If you have pico-8 simply download the pico-8 file and place it in your /carts path. Then have fun with it.

Feel free to modify this code however you wish.
